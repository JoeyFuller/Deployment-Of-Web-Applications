#URL SHORTENER API(Static)
##Joey Fuller

**URL SHORTENER API** is a project started by myself for a school assignment. Code is subject to random and maybe mistaken changes. Use as an educational purpose at your own risk.

##Install
To install the **URL SHORTENER API** please clone or download the v1.0.0 via [THIS LINK](https://github.com/JoeyFuller/Deployment-Of-Web-Applications.git).

Some other files you will need include Node.js [LINK](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM [LINK](https://www.npmjs.com) which will both need to be install prior to installing the **URL SHORTENER API**.

After both Node.js and NPM are installed, open your command line or terminal and navigate to the directory you where you stored the repo files.

```
$CD /YOUR DIRECTORY/Deployment-Of-Web-Applications-master
```

Once you have reached your directory run the following command.

```
npm install
```
This will install everything needed(including dependencies).
##Routes
To view the "home page" navigate to

```
http://localhost:3000/
```
where you will see a simple message displayed as a JSON object. Future changes will show more user friendly interfaces and have actual functionality.

##Endpoints
The endpoint currently active is

```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/urls
```
This is ment to display a shortened URL or in this case a placeholder url with a 4 digit short code added. EX:

```
short_url:dj32
```
